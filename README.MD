# eBird Fallout (browser extension)

## Summary

eBird is already pretty great. But a some pages have data that I want to download. This extension lets you do that.

## What data does it download?

1. **Targets Page**: This works (excludes hybrids)
2. **Needs Alert**: In Progress
3. **Rare Alerts**: In Progress

## How to Use

1. Install the extension from the browser's extension store.
2. Click on the extension icon in the toolbar to open the popup.
3. Click the download.

## Development

So part of the fun I had with this was to use ChatGPT to write a lot of the code. I didn't test it a ton, but it does work for the several attempts I used and I didn't want to spend forever working on it. Honestly getting the javascript working in a browser extension was the hardest part, given all the nuances of the different browsers.

I used the Manifeset v3 standard and I tested it in Firefox and Brave, so I assume it should work in most other Chromium-based browsers.

## Feedback and Contributions

Feedback and contributions are welcome. Please open an issue on the GitHub repository if you have any suggestions or find any bugs. Zero guarantees as to if I have time to work on it. :)
